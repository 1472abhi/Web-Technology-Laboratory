		<p>Before coding of the website, planning is important, students should visit different websites (Min.
			5) for the different client projects and note down the evaluation results for these websites, either
			good website or bad website in following format: <br>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Sr. No.</th>
					<th>Website URL</th>
					<th>Purpose of Website</th>
					<th>Things liked in the website</th>
					<th>Things disliked in the website</th>
					<th>Overall evaluation of the website (Good/Bad)</th>
				</tr>
				</table>
				From the evaluation, students should learn and conclude different website design issues, which
should be considered while developing a website.
